Hornets is a comic about Moe, a kid with a ‘horizontal Mohawk’ trying to get through everyday life, with his friends Tai, Nerdy, Raman, and his siblings, Mylie and Mango. Together, they get into many shenanigans, like digging a hole to China, going on a trip to Hawaii, or getting prepared for summer vacation in their hometown, Yellowjacket City.
